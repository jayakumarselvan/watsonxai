IBM spent nearly a decade honing its vision for quantum advantage and large scale fault tolerant quantum computing and now that vision is coming into focus in twenty twenty six we will see the first demonstrations of quantum advantage and in twenty twenty nine will enter into a new era of computation but the first large scale fault tolerant quantum computer we know exactly how it should be and we're updating a roadmap to match let's take a look today's IBM quantum road map is really two roadmaps and want our development roadmap tracks production systems and software tools to enable advantage for end users and our innovation roadmap tracks experimental work and prototypes that inform production hardware and software and our journey to falter let's start by looking at how our development roadmap lays out the path to quantum advantage last year released yet which demonstrated significantly improved gait performance thanks to its durable couple architecture and the ability to accurately run circuits with five thousand we believe advantage will occur in the next few years if we continue to push our hardware performance and couple it with high performance classical computer to facilitate that effort we're excited to announce a new processor coming in twenty twenty five the IBM night nighthawk introduces a new square lattice one hundred and twenty cubits targeting five thousand gates are delivers roughly sixteen times defective circuit depth we can achieve with the heavy hex lattice of its predecessor this will make it possible for our clients and users run much more complex circuits can achieve quantum advantage in the near future twenty twenty six and twenty twenty seven night hawk will integrate the meter length chip to chip couplers first demonstrated in our twenty twenty four flamingo chip belongs to scale at first at three hundred sixty cubits then to one thousand and eighty or push the quality as well what circuit depths reaching fifteen thousand by twenty twenty however our users need more than just state of the art quantum hardware they also need high performance software to power the next generation of quantum out since twenty seventeen with work to make the just get us to create the world's most performing quantum software development can grow it beyond the chorus J. into a comprehensive software stack for running utility scale circuits on the clock in twenty twenty five our latest generation just a runtime engine will improve scalability of dynamic circuits which leverage real time classical logic to make quantum circuits more power at the same time our new C. API will allow more direct integrations of casket in HPC environment one rollout profiling tools in twenty twenty six and workforce all readers in twenty twenty eight to future optimize communication between quantum and classical resources advancing error mitigation capabilities will be essential for reaching advantage before fault that's why it's twenty twenty five we're expanding our mitigation tools to better leverage HTC and enable more complex work in twenty twenty six will build on that foundation with the utility mapping tools to facilitate algorithm discovery for quantum advantage in twenty twenty nine will provide new circuit libraries for fault tolerant diverse as we see the first examples of wanted vantage will team up with our partners to expand our functions catalog and roll out a use case benchmarking tool to establish standards for advantage in key application segments then in twenty twenty seven will introduce competition libraries that extend each PC map libraries to efficiently run Qantas now let's talk about the journey to fault tolerance outlined on our innovation group from twenty twenty to twenty twenty three we focused on increasing yield and solving packaging challenges with the IBM falcon hummingbird eagle osprey and condor ships we expanded our knowledge of monolithic scaling showing that we can successfully test the system even with the one thousand plus cubic condor processor to scale further we need a modular approach in twenty twenty four we demonstrate across bill informing which showed our chip to chip couple technologies at different length scales now what a well formed realization of our quantum LDPC error correcting codes it's time to update our innovation central to our queue LDPC approach hi can activity and multi way couplers firing nonlocal get connections and an advanced automated design we're excited to introduce live in twenty twenty five as our target for demonstrating these technologies building on their own we'll be kookaburra in twenty twenty six the first demonstration of a module in our fault tolerant quantum computing architecture the module includes an encoded quantum memory with a logical processing unit for logical operations in twenty twenty seven we get cockatoo which demonstrates entanglement of modules with a universal adapter all made possible by the long range couplers for shown informing in twenty twenty eight everything comes together in a first prototype of a fault tolerant quantum computer when starlink which ties together multiple modules with universal computation to magic state distortion twenty twenty nine IBM starlink makes its way to the development wrote as a fully delivered fault tolerant quantum computer capable of running circuits with one hundred million games on two hundred logical keep back in twenty thirty three we scale beyond startling to blue chip a quantum computer capable of running one billion gates on two thousand logical Cubans so twenty twenty five we get night hawk and an expanded set of quantum plus HPC tools to help you take full advantage of its increase connected in twenty twenty six we will see the first demonstrations of quantum advantage in twenty twenty seven and twenty twenty eight we will expand the variety of problems we can tackle with next generation computational methods and build a wider range of quantum advantage and in twenty twenty nine will enter into a new era of computation with the first large scale fault tolerant quantum computer and unlock an even wider range of use cases across industries we hope you'll join us on this journey
